  <p><b><u>Climate change</b></u>, also called Global Warming, refers to the rise in average surface temperatures on Earth. An overwhelming scientific consensus maintains that <b><u>climate change</b></u> is due primarily to the human use of fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide other greenhouses gases into the air. The gases trap heat within the atmosphere, which can have a range of effects on ecosystems, including rising sea levels, sever weather events, and droughts that render landscapes more susceptible to wildfires.
<hr>
Even small increases in Earth's temperature caused by <b><u>climate change</b></u> can have severe effects. <mark>The earth's average temnperature has gone 1.4 °F over the past century and is expected to rise as much as 11.5 °F over the next.</mark> That might seem like a lot, but <mark>the average temperature during the last lce Age was about 4 °F lower that it is today.</mark>
<hr>
  <small><del>Oppression</del></small> Occurs whenever one person exercises authority or power in unfair, abusive, cruel, or needlessly controlling way. For example, a parent who locks a child in the closet could be said to be oppressing that child. Slavery, the refusal to allow women to inherit the own property, the denial of equal rights to people with disabilities, and the involuntary commitment of people who deviate from social norms are all examples of <small><del>oppression</del></small>
